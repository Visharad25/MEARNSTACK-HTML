		<h2> Patrick Young </h2>
		<p>
			I am a lecturer in the Stanford Computer Science Department. Before coming to Standford, I spent two years as a programmer
			at Taligent (now part of IBM). At Taligent, I worked on Places for Project Teams, a groupware product designed to improve 
			communication and coordination within small project teams. I was fortunate to work with the Plces for Project Teams product
			throughout an entire software lifecycle---from initial product conception through the actual product launch.
			<br/> <br/>
			I have a Ph.D. from the University of California, Irvine, where I specialized in Software Engineering. My dissertation was on 
			process support for software engineering teams. I also have a masters dgeree from Irvine, with a specialization in Artificial 
			Intelligence, and bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.
